                Colonization is the process by which a larger dominant territory or country exerts its dominance over a smaller, weaker, less-developed territory taking control of essential sectors such as the social, political and economic affairs. 
                  Colonization typically seeps into the societies of the smaller territories where the influence and customs of the larger territory, known as colonial influence, becomes embedded and entrenched in to the social, political and economic happenings of the smaller society. 
                  Colonization was an instrument of oppression and suppression aimed at eliminating Caribbean uniqueness and individuality and promotes European admiration. Based on the literature, the sector in which colonization was most notably observed in was that of the educational sector.  
                  The education system was developed and established in such a way as to promote European superiority and encourage European admiration. 
                  The education system was a vehicle in which Caribbean students could be subliminally and subconscious fed solely European content in an official setting that was taught to be ‘right’. By doing this, the European content and customs would be preserved and maintain in the society and would be an endless cycle of loyalty to the European way from generation to generation.<br>

                  For example Una had to complete the Oxford and Cambridge Boards’ Lower Certificate which was based on a Britain curriculum.
